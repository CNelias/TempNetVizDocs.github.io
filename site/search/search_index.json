Installation TempGraphViz is part of the Python Package Index and can be installed via pip install tempnetviz . To simplify data exploration, the package provides a GUI accessible with python -m tempgraphviz.main_gui . You can also call its functions directly through the API . Quickstart Your data should be stored in a single folder, as .csv files . Each .csv file representing a graph at a given time point of the analysis. To start the GUI, run python -m tempnetviz.main_gui . Then: Click Open in the GUI to select the folder containing your .csv files. Use the Sub-graph selector to choose one or multiple layers to visualize or analyze. Adjust the metrics to explore structural properties of your data. You can apply a graph cut (edge pruning) for better readability on large graphs. Switch between Graph , Histogram , and Animation views to gain different insights. You can apply aesthetic changes (e.g. edge/nodes widths, colors...) to the results via the Settings button. Main Functionalities Below, we show the main visualization tools available. The API section comes with details and examples on how to use each of these functions within Python scripts. Multilayer stack This is the default view in the GUI: a 3D stack that lets you see how connections evolve as a function of time. You can also compute various metrics that quantify the importance of the nodes in the graph. More important nodes will be displayed larger as others. In this example, a colormap was also applied to make the results more explicit. This can be via the settings button in the GUI or via the node_cmap and edge_cmap arguments of the display_graph function. Metrics distribution Visualize how metrics evolve over time using histograms. By default, the different time steps are stacked on top of each other for easier comparison. In this example, deep blue corresponds to early times and deep red to the last datapoints. You can also plot each time step side by side by changing the corresponding option in the settings or by calling the function display_stats with stacked = False . Graph animation It is also possible to display the time evolution of the graph as an animation Temporal Layout You can also display the results as a temporal layout. At each timestep, this representation orders the nodes on the y axis to reduce edge-overlap. In this example, the color and thickness of node a shows its strength value. Example on real data Let us now apply TempNetViz to real data. Here we will reproduce the results of the article Stable clique membership in mouse societies requires oxytocin-enabled social sensory states . This study shows that in groups of mice living in semi-naturalistic environments, highly social and stable cliques tend to emerge (so called rich-club). The data needed to reproduce this example can be found here . After loading the data, the corresponding multi-layer graph looks like this: We first apply a graph cut to prune some of the weakest edges. If we did not do this, the graph would be fully connected, which would mask any differences in connectivity. For that we use the \"mutual nearest neighbors\" option, as we care about reciprocal edges. We choose the value of 3. We now have a graph which is a bit easier to understand: Finally, to visualize the particularly influencial nodes, we select the \"rich-club\" metric, and choose a degree of 3. That means that we retain only nodes with degree >= 3. We see that at each time step, some node come in an out of the rich-club, but some consistently stay in it over the whole experiment. In the article, the emergence of these stable rich-club was linked to the oxytocin pathways. Importantly, mice with impaired cortical oxytocin signaling were unable to enter such stable rich-clubs","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#tempgraphviz","text":"A Python package for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing temporal graphs .","title":"TempGraphViz"},{"location":"#installation","text":"TempGraphViz is part of the Python Package Index and can be installed via pip install tempnetviz .

In such cases, graph pruning can help improve visibility while preserving the essential features in the data. TempNetViz offers several ways to do this, available with the graph cut button. Graph cuts are used to simplify the network by removing weak or irrelevant edges , making patterns easier to analyze and visualize. Below is a list of the available cut or pruning methods available. Threshold Cut Removes the weakest connections in the graph. You choose a percentage (relative to the strongest connection), and all edges below this level are hidden. Example: If the strongest connection has weight 100, and you set the threshold to 10%, then all edges weaker than 10 are removed. Best for: filtering out background noise while keeping dominant patterns visible. Nearest Neighbors Cut (NN Cut) For each node, only its top k strongest connections are kept. You decide how many neighbors should remain connected (e.g., k = 2 or 3...). Each node stays connected to a limited number of its closest partners. Best for: focusing on local structures around each node and avoiding clutter from weak links. Mutual Nearest Neighbors Cut (MNN Cut) A stricter version of NN Cut. Here, a connection between two nodes is kept only if both nodes rank each other among their top neighbors . Creates a much sparser graph, highlighting only the most reciprocal and reliable relationships . Best for: revealing core structures and strongly linked communities. Quick Guide: Which Cut to Choose?

The graph displays raw edge weights only. Strength The sum of edge weights connected to a node. A higher strength means the node has stronger or more numerous connections. Betweenness Measures how often a node appears on the shortest paths between other nodes. Nodes with high betweenness act as important bridges in the network. Closeness Reflects how close a node is to all other nodes in the network. Nodes with high closeness can reach others quickly (shorter average path length). Eigenvector Centrality Measures a node\u2019s influence based on the idea that connections to important nodes contribute more than connections to less important ones. PageRank A variant of eigenvector centrality. It gives higher scores to nodes connected to other highly connected nodes. Originally developed for ranking webpages.
